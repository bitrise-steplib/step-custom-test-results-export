  Export test results to Test Reports add-on
summary: |
  This Step is used to search for test results and export them for the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step which can export the results to the testing add-on.
description: |
  Not all testing Steps automatically export their results to the Test Reports add-on. This Step is designed to export the results of those Steps that do not do this automatically. The Step creates the required `test-info.json` file and deploys the test results in the correct directory for export.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To use this Step to export the results of a testing Step - for example, **Flutter Test** -, you need to make sure that:

  - The Step knows which folder to look for your test results.
  - The Step knows which file to look for.
  - The Step exports to the correct directory.

  1. In the **The name of the test** input, set the name you want to see in the Test Reports add-on. Each exported results file has a separate tab with the name defined here.

  2. In the **Test result base path** input, set the path where your test results can be found.

     This input determines where Bitrise will look for your test results. We recommend setting a folder here though you can also set a specific file path.

  3. In the **Test result search pattern** input, set a glob pattern that matches a single test result output file.

     This search pattern is used to search every file and folder of the provided base path which was set in the **Test result base path** input. If there is more than one match, you will receive a warning and the step will export the first match.

     If you set a specific file path in the previous input, just set `*` here.

  4. In the **Step's test result directory** input, make sure the path points to a valid directory.

     By default, do NOT modify this input’s value. It should be set to the $BITRISE_TEST_RESULT_DIR Env Var.

  5. Make sure you have a Deploy to Bitrise.io Step in your Workflow. This step is responsible for deploying the exported files from the test result directory to the Test Reports add-on.

  ### Troubleshooting

  - You always need a **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step in your Workflow to export test results to the Test Reports add-on. If you can't see your results in Test Reports, check that you have the Step in your Workflow.

  - If more than one file matches the pattern set in the **Test result search pattern** input, you will receive a warning. It should only match a single file in the base path.

  - If either the **Test result base path** input or the **Test result search pattern** input isn't set correctly or if either is left empty, the Step will fail.

        You can provide a path to a single file or a directory path and filter for files using the **Test result search pattern** input.

        This is the base path where the Step will look for your test results. We recommend using a relative path to the results:

        `app/build/test-results/testDemoDebugUnitTest/`
        
        or 
        
        `./app/build/test-results/testDemoDebugUnitTest/`

      summary: A glob pattern to match a single test report within the base path. 
      description: |
        This glob should match a single file within the provided base path.
        If it matches multiple files, the Step will produce a warning displaying all matches.
        The matched file should be in a supported format. If you set a specific file path in the **Test result base path** input, set this value to *.
        
        **Examples**:
        
        Matching all files within the base path: `*`
        
        Matching all files within a given directory of the base path: `*/build/test-results/testDemoDebugUnitTest/*`
