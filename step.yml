  Custom Test Results Export
summary: |
  This Step is used to search for test results and export them for the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step which can export the results to the testing add-on.
description: |
  Not all testing Steps automatically export their results to the Test Reports add-on. This Step is designed to export the results of those Steps that do not do this automatically. The Step creates the required `test-info.json` file and deploys the test results in the correct directory for export.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To use this Step to export the results of a testing Step - for example, **Flutter Test** -, you need to make sure that:

  - The Step knows which folder to look for your test results.
  - The Step knows which file to look for.
  - The Step exports to the correct directory.

  1. In the **The name of the test** input, set the name you want to be shown in the Test Reports add-on.

  1. In the **Path where custom test results reside** input, set the path where your test results can be found.

     This input determines where Bitrise will look for your test results. We recommend setting a folder here though you can also set a specific filepath.

  1. In the **Test result search pattern** input, set a pattern that matches a single test result output file.  

     This search pattern is used to search every file and folder of the provided base path which was set in the Path where custom test results reside input. If there is more than one match, you will receive a warning.

     If you set a specific filepath in the previous input, just set * here.

  1. In the **Step's test result directory** input, make sure the path is correct.

     By default, do NOT modify this input’s value. It should be set to the $BITRISE_TEST_RESULT_DIR Env Var.

  1. Make sure you have a Deploy to Bitrise.io Step in your Workflow.

  ### Troubleshooting

  - You always need a **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step in your Workflow to export test results to the Test Reports add-on. If you can't see your results in Test Reports, check that you have the Step in your Workflow.

  - If more than one file matches the pattern set in the **Test result search pattern** input, you will receive a warning. It should only match a single file in the base path.

  - If either the **Path where custom test results reside** input or the **Test result search pattern** input isn't set correctly or if either is left empty, the Step will fail.
